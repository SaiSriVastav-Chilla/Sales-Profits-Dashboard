**🧭 Total Sales & Profit Dashboard (Tableau)**

This project showcases two interactive Tableau dashboards: Total Sales Dashboard and Total Profit Dashboard, designed to provide a 360° view of company performance through sales, profit, and order insights. The dashboards analyze business performance across multiple dimensions such as time, region, state, category, and sub-category, enabling quick, data-driven decision-making.

**📊 Project Overview**

The dashboards were created using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, containing detailed transactional data including sales, profit, and order information. The objective was to:

-Track key business metrics (KPIs) over time

-Identify top-performing regions, states, and categories

-Visualize trends and performance growth compared to the previous year (PY)

-Enable stakeholders to explore sales and profit distributions interactively
